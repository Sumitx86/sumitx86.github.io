<body>
    <p>A fractal is a essentially a geometric (mathematical) pattern. In
 fact, fractals can be found all around you in your every day life in 
things like plants, clouds, and even the blood vessels in your body!</p>

    <p class="instructions">Simply move your mouse over the fractals.</p>

    <h2>Cantor Set:</h2>
    <p>The cantor set was one of the first fractals to be studied in 
detail and is perhaps one of the simplest to generate. Just take a line,
 remove some percentage of its length from the middle (eg 1/3). Then 
continually repeat this process for each sub-line (each line on either 
side of the newly formed gap).</p>
    <div class="canvas_wrapper">
        <canvas width="650px" height="400px" id="cantor_canvas">
            <div class="no_canvas">
                <strong>Sorry, It looks as though your browser does not support the canvas tag...</strong> If you can, I suggest that you should try firefox or Safari.
            </div>
        </canvas>
    </div>

    <h2>Pythagoras Tree:</h2>
    <p>The Pythagoras tree starts with a simple square. Next two 
slightly smaller squares are placed on top such that their corners match
 up pairwise (forming a triangle composed of two right triangles). This 
is then repeated for each "branch" of the tree. By moving your mouse up 
and down in the middle of the canvas below, a true Pythagoras tree can 
be seen. If the mouse is moved at all to either side, an asymmetric tree
 is generated.</p>
    <div class="canvas_wrapper">
        <canvas width="650px" height="393px" id="pythagoras_canvas">
            <div class="no_canvas">
                <strong>Sorry, It looks as though your browser does not support the canvas tag...</strong> If you can, I suggest that you should try firefox or Safari.
            </div>
        </canvas>
    </div>

    <h2>Koch Curve:</h2>
    <p>The koch curve (if you want to call it a curve) is created by 
taking a line segment, dividing it into thirds and constructing an 
equilateral triangle in place of the center third of the original 
segment. An interesting fact about the Koch curve is that it has 
infinite length as at each step in the generation process the overall 
length of the line is increased by one third. As well for the math nerds
 out there: The Koch curve is continuous but not differentiable.</p>

            </div>
        </canvas>
    </div>

    <h2>H-Tree:</h2>
    <p>An H-Tree is constructed very much like a real tree (though not 
random by any means). It gets it's name from the fact that when the 
angle between the two branches is 180 degrees, an H shape is formed. 
Oddly enough, this pattern has been found to be useful in designing 
small antenna.</p>

        <canvas width="650px" height="470px" id="tree_canvas">
            <div class="no_canvas">
                <strong>Sorry, It looks as though your browser does not support the canvas tag...</strong> If you can, I suggest that you should try firefox or Safari.
            </div>
    </canvas>
    </div>

    <h2>Sierpinski Carpet:</h2>
    <p>The Sierpinski Carpet is created by dividing the original shape 
into 9 squares then removing the center square. This process is then 
repeated recursively for the other 8 squares. Fun fact about the 
Sierpinski carpet: If an infinite number of iterations is performed, the
 total surface area of the carpet is eventually reduced to zero.</p>
