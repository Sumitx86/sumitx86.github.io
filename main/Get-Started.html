<h3><b> Basics of C Programming...</b></h3> 
<marquee><p><i>Before Learning C you have to know about..</i></p> </marquee>

<div class="w3-card-24" style="margin: 0px;padding:15px;">
<h3>Semicolons</h3>
<p>
In a C program, the semicolon is a statement terminator. That is, each individual statement must be ended with a semicolon. It indicates the end of one logical entity.
</p><p>
Given below are two different statements -
</p><pre class="prettyprint">
printf("Hello, World! \n");
return 0;</pre>
<h3>Comments</h3>
<p>
Comments are like helping text in your C program and they are ignored by the compiler. They start with /* and terminate with the characters */ as shown below -
</p><pre class="prettyprint">
/* my first program in C */</pre>
<h3>Identifiers
</h3><p>
A C identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, or any other user-defined item. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z, a to z, or an underscore '_' followed by zero or more letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9).
</p><p>
C does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. C is a case-sensitive programming language. Thus, Manpower and manpower are two different identifiers in C. Here are some examples of acceptable identifiers -
</p><pre class="prettyprint">
mohd       zara    abc   move_name  a_123
myname50   _temp   j     a23b9      retVal</pre>
<h3>Keywords</h3>
<p>
The following list shows the reserved words in C. These reserved words may not be used as constants or variables or any other identifier names.
</p><pre class="prettyprint">
auto 	else 	long 	switch
break 	enum 	register 	typedef
case 	extern 	return 	union
char 	float 	short 	unsigned
const 	for 	signed 	void
continue 	goto 	sizeof 	volatile
default 	if 	static 	while
do 	int 	struct 	_Packed
double 	</pre>
<h3>Whitespace in C</h3>
<p>
A line containing only whitespace, possibly with a comment, is known as a blank line, and a C compiler totally ignores it.
</p><p>
Whitespace is the term used in C to describe blanks, tabs, newline characters and comments. Whitespace separates one part of a statement from another and enables the compiler to identify where one element in a statement, such as int, ends and the next element begins. Therefore, in the following statement -
</p><pre class="prettyprint">
int age;
</pre><p>
there must be at least one whitespace character (usually a space) between int and age for the compiler to be able to distinguish them. On the other hand, in the following statement -
</p><pre class="prettyprint">
fruit = apples + oranges;   // get the total fruit
</pre><p>
no whitespace characters are necessary between fruit and =, or between = and apples, although you are free to include some if you wish to increase readability.
</p>

<h3>C - printf and scanf:</h3>
<p>printf() and scanf() functions are inbuilt library functions in C which are available in the C library by default. These functions are declared and related 
macros are defined in "stdio.h" which is a header file. We have to include "stdio.h" file as shown in below C program to make use of these printf() and scanf()
</p>
</div><div class="w3-card-24" style="margin: 0px;padding:15px;">

<h3>C - Data Types:</h3>
<p>C data types are defined as the data storage format that a variable can store a data to perform a specific operation. Data types are used to define a
 variable before using in a program. Size of variable, const and array are determined by data types. There are four data types in the C language.</p>
 
</div>
<div class="w3-card-24" style="margin: 0px;padding:15px;">
 
 <h3>C - Tokens and keywords:</h3>
<p>C tokens, Identifiers and Keywords are the basics in a C program. All are explained in this page with definition and simple example programs. C tokens
 are the basic building blocks in C language which are constructed together to write a C program. Each program element in a C program is given a name called</p>
 <h3>Tokens </h3>
		<p>
A C program consists of various tokens and a token is either a keyword, an identifier, a constant, a string literal, or a symbol. For example, the following C statement consists of five tokens -
printf("Hello, World! \n");	</p>	
	
<p>The individual tokens are -</p>


		<pre class="prettyprint"style="width:30%;">
printf
(
"Hello, World! \n"
);
</pre></div>
 
<div class="w3-card-24" style="margin: 0px;padding:15px;">
  <h3>C - Constants:</h3>
<p>C Constants are also like normal variables. But, the only difference is, their values can't be modified by the program once they are defined. Constants 
refer to fixed values. They are also called as literals.</p>
</div><div class="w3-card-24" style="margin: 0px;padding:15px;">

<h3>C - Variables:</h3>
<p>C variable is a named location in a memory where a program can manipulate the data. This location is used to hold the value of the variable. The value of 
the C variable may get changed in the program. The C variable might be belonging to any of the data types like int, float, char etc</p>
</div><div class="w3-card-24" style="margin: 0px;padding:15px;">

<h3>C - Operators and Expressions:</h3>
<p>The symbols which are used to perform logical and mathematical operations in a C program are called C operators. These C operators join individual 
constants and variables to form expressions. Operators, functions, constants and variables are combined together to form expressions.</p>
</div><div class="w3-card-24" style="margin: 0px;padding:15px;">

<h3>C - Decision Control statements:</h3>
<p>In decision control statements (C - if else and nested if), group of statement is executed when the condition is true.  If  the condition is false, then,
 else part statements are executed. In C programming, there are 3 types of decision making control statements in C language.</p>
</div><div class="w3-card-24" style="margin: 0px;padding:15px;">

<h3>C - Loop control statements:</h3>
<p>Loop control statements in C programming are used to perform looping operations until the given condition is true. Control comes out of the loop statements
 once the condition becomes false. There are 3 types of loop control statements in C language.</p>
 </div><div class="w3-card-24" style="margin: 0px;padding:15px;">

<h3>C - Case control statements:</h3>
<p>The statements which are used to execute only specific block of statements in a series of blocks are called case control statements. There are 4 types of 
case control statements in C programming. They are 1) switch 2) break 3) continue 4) </p>
</div><div class="w3-card-24" style="margin: 0px;padding:15px;">

<h3>C - Type Qualifiers:</h3>
<p>
The keywords which are used to modify the properties of a variable are called type qualifiers.There are two types of qualifiers available in C programming. They are 1) const 2) volatile. Constants are also like normal variables..</p>
 </div><div class="w3-card-24" style="margin: 0px;padding:15px;">

<h3>C - Storage Class Specifiers:</h3>
<p>Storage class specifiers in C programming tell the compiler where to store a variable, how to store the variable, what is the initial value of the variable 
and the lifetime of the variable. There are 4 storage class specifiers available in C language.</p>
</div><div class="w3-card-24" style="margin: 0px;padding:15px;">

<h3>C - Array:</h3>
<p>C Array is a collection of variables belongings to the same data type. You can store group of data of the same data type in an array. There are 2 types of
 arrays in C programming. They are 1) One dimensional array 2) Multidimensional array..</p>
</div><div class="w3-card-24" style="margin: 0px;padding:15px;">

<h3>C - String:</h3>
<p>C Strings are nothing but array of characters ended with null character ('\0'). This null character indicates the end of the string. In C programming, 
strings are always enclosed by double quotes. Whereas, character is enclosed by single quotes in C</p>
</div><div class="w3-card-24" style="margin: 0px;padding:15px;">

<h3>C - Pointer:</h3>
<p>C Pointer is a variable that stores/points the address of the other variable. C Pointer is used to allocate memory dynamically,  i.e. at run time. 
The variable might be any of the data types such as int, float, char, double, short etc. Normal variable stores the value, whereas pointer variable stores the
 address of the variable.</p>
 </div><div class="w3-card-24" style="margin: 0px;padding:15px;">

<h3>C Programming - Functions:</h3>
<p>Functions in C programming are basic building blocks in a program. All C programs are written using functions to improve re-usability, understandability 
and to keep track of them. A large C program is divided into basic building blocks called C function. C function contains set of instructions enclosed
 by "{  }" which performs specific.</p> 
</div><div class="w3-card-24" style="margin: 0px;padding:15px;">

 <h3>C Programming - Library functions:</h3>
<p>Library functions in C language are inbuilt functions which are grouped together and placed in a common place called a library. Each library function in C
 programming language performs a specific operation. We can make use of these library functions to get the pre-defined output instead of writing our own code 
 to get those outputs.,.</p>
</div><div class="w3-card-24" style="margin: 0px;padding:15px;">

 <h3>C Programming - Command line arguments:</h3>
<p>main() function of a C program accepts arguments from command line or from other shell scripts by following commands. They are 1. argc 2. argv[]. In real 
time application, it will happen to pass arguments to the main program itself.  These arguments are passed to the main () function while executing binary file
 from command line..</p>
 </div><div class="w3-card-24" style="margin: 0px;padding:15px;">

 <h3>C programming - Variable length argument:</h3>
<p>
Variable length arguments in C programming are an advanced concept offered by C99 standard. In C89 standard, fixed arguments only can be passed to the 
functions. When a function gets the number of arguments that changes at run time, we can go for a variable length arguments. It is denoted as (3 dots).</p>
