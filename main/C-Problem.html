<h3> Simple Programming Problems</h3>

<p>I suppose they are also useful, although much easier, whenever an experienced person wants to learn a new language.</p>
<p>If your language of choice doesn't have a build in list and/or string type (e.g. you use C), these exercises should also be solvable for arrays. 
However, some solutions are very different between an array-based list and a pointer based list, at least if you care about the efficiency of your code.
 So you might want to either find a library, or investigate how to implement your own linked list if your language doesn't have it.

Try different bases. What is the best base if you care about speed? If you couldn't completely solve the prime number exercise above due to the lack of large numbers in your language, you can now use your own library for this task.

    <h4>Implement a data structure for graphs that allows modification (insertion, deletion). It should be possible to store values at edges and nodes. It might be easiest to use a dictionary of (node, edgelist) to do this.

        Using a sample text, create a directed (multi-)graph where the words of a text are nodes and there is a directed edge between u and v if u is followed by v in your sample text. Multiple occurrences lead to multiple edges.
        Do a random walk on this graph: Starting from an arbitrary node choose a random successor. If no successor exists, choose another random node.
   </div><div class="w3 w3-container w3-blue">
    </h4><h4>Write a program that automatically converts English text to Morse code and vice versa.
   </div><div class="w3 w3-container w3-teal">
   </h4><h4> Write a program that finds the longest palindromic substring of a given string. Try to be as efficient as possible!
   </div><div class="w3 w3-container w3-green">
    </h4><h4>Think of a good interface for a list. What operations do you typically need? You might want to investigate the list interface in your language and in some other popular languages for inspiration.
   </div><div class="w3 w3-container w3-blue">
   </h4><h4> Implement your list interface using a fixed chunk of memory, say an array of size 100. If the user wants to add more stuff to your list than fits in your memory you should produce some kind of error, for example you can throw an exception if your language supports that.
   </div><div class="w3 w3-container w3-teal">
   </h4><h4> Improve your previous implementation such that an arbitrary number of elements can be stored in your list. You can for example allocate bigger and bigger chunks of memory as your list grows, copy the old elements over and release the old storage. You should probably also release this memory eventually if your list shrinks enough not to need it anymore. Think about how much bigger the new chunk of memory should be so that your performance won't be killed by allocations. Increasing the size by 1 element for example is a bad idea.
   </div><div class="w3 w3-container w3-green">
   </h4><h4> If you chose your growth right in the previous problem, you typically won’t allocate very often. However, adding to a big list sometimes consumes considerable time. That might be problematic in some applications. Instead try allocating new chunks of memory for new items. So when your list is full and the user wants to add something, allocate a new chunk of 100 elements instead of copying all elements over to a new large chunk. Think about where to do the book-keeping about which chunks you have. Different book keeping strategies can quite dramatically change the performance characteristics of your list.
   </div><div class="w3 w3-container w3-blue">
   </h4><h4> Implement a binary heap. Once using a list as the base data structure and once by implementing a pointer-linked binary tree. Use it for implementing heap-sort.
   </div><div class="w3 w3-container w3-teal">
   </h4><h4> Implement an unbalanced binary search tree.
   </div><div class="w3 w3-container w3-green">
   </h4><h4> Implement a balanced binary search tree of your choice. I like (a,b)-trees best.
   </div><div class="w3 w3-container w3-blue">
   </h4><h4> Compare the performance of insertion, deletion and search on your unbalanced search tree with your balanced search tree and a sorted list. Think about good input sequences. If you implemented an (a,b)-tree, think about good values of a and b.

   <div class="w3 w3-container w3-green">
   <h4> Given two strings, write a program that efficiently finds the longest common subsequence.
   </div><div class="w3 w3-container w3-blue">
   </h4><h4> Given an array with numbers, write a program that efficiently answers queries of the form: "Which is the nearest larger value for the number at position i?", where distance is the difference in array indices. For example in the array [1,4,3,2,5,7], the nearest larger value for 4 is 5. After linear time preprocessing you should be able to answer queries in constant time.

   </h4><h4> Given two strings, write a program that outputs the shortest sequence of character insertions and deletions that turn one string into the other.
   </div><div class="w3 w3-container w3-brown">
   </h4><h4> Write a function that multiplies two matrices together. Make it as efficient as you can and compare the performance to a polished linear algebra library for your language. You might want to read about Strassen’s algorithm and the effects CPU caches have. Try out different matrix layouts and see what happens.

    </h4><h4>Implement a van Emde Boas tree. Compare it with your previous search tree implementations.
